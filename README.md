# Calculator Project
This project consists of two implementations of a basic calculator to compare different approaches in web development. The two versions are built using distinct technologies: plain JavaScript and React with Vite.

 ## JavaScript Calculator
This implementation uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a simple calculator with a responsive UI and basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additional functionalities include clearing the input, backspacing, and handling parentheses.

## Technologies:

* HTML for structure
* CSS for styling
* JavaScript for functionality

## Key Features:

* Real-time calculation updates
* Clear and backspace buttons
* Basic arithmetic operations
* Error handling for invalid expressions

## Pros:

* Simple to understand and modify
* No additional build tools or libraries required

## Cons:

* Less modular and maintainable compared to modern frameworks
* Limited scalability for complex features

## Running this Calculator:

1. Clone the repo:

``
git clone https://github.com/Joronod/FE-Calculator.git
``

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

`` cd JS-calculator ``

3. Open the `` index.html `` file in a web browser: Simply double-click `` index.html `` or drag it into a web browser to view and interact with the calculator.

## React Vite Calculator
This version uses React and Vite to build a more modern calculator. It employs React's component-based architecture and state management with hooks for a clean and scalable codebase. Vite is used for fast build and development.

## Technologies:

* React for UI components
* Vite for development and build tooling
* CSS for styling

## Key Features:

* Component-based design with reusable components
* State management with hooks
* Enhanced performance with Vite

## Pros:

* Modular and maintainable code
* Easier to extend with additional features
* Improved development experience with Vite

## Cons:

* Requires familiarity with React and modern build tools
* Larger initial setup compared to plain JavaScript

## Running this Calculator:

1. Clone the Repo

`` 
git clone https://github.com/Joronod/FE-Calculator.git
``

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

``
cd react-vite-calculator
``

3. Install Dependencies with ``npm install``

4. Start the Development Server with `` npm run dev ``

Both implementations provide a solid foundation for understanding different development approaches, from traditional methods to modern frameworks.
